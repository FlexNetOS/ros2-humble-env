# ros2-humble-env

a reproducible and declarative development environment for ros2 humble using nix flakes and pixi for cross-platform compatibility. this repository is meant to be used as a "template" repository for robotics projects to offer a easy starting environment with a working ros2 install.

## overview

this repository provides a complete development setup for ros2 humble with all necessary build tools and dependencies pre-configured. the environment seems to work properly both on linux and macos (x86 and arm64) using:

- **nix flakes**: for reproducible, declarative environment setup
- **pixi**: for python and ros package management via robostack
- **direnv** (optional): for automatic environment activation

## getting started

### quick bootstrap

use the included bootstrap scripts to automate the setup:

**Linux/macOS/WSL2:**
```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\bootstrap.ps1
```

the bootstrap script will verify prerequisites and run `pixi install` automatically.

### prerequisites

- nix with flakes enabled
- git

### installing nix (if not already installed)

personally, i like to use the [experimental nix install script](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://artifacts.nixos.org/experimental-installer | \
  sh -s -- install
```

it installs nix with `flakes` and `nix-command` enabled by default. it also offers an easy-to-use uninstaller in case you decide you don't want it anymore (`/nix/nix-installer uninstall`). alternatively, you can follow the [official nix installation instructions](https://nixos.org/download.html).

### enter the development environment

#### using direnv (recommended)

if you have direnv installed, simply enter the directory:

```bash
cd ros2-humble-env
```

direnv will automatically load the environment. on first run, you may need to:

```bash
direnv allow
```

#### using nix develop

alternatively, activate the environment manually:

```bash
nix develop
```

or with `nom` for better build output:

```bash
nom develop
```

## neovim ide (optional)

the environment includes neovim with lazyvim preconfigured for ros2 development. to set up neovim:

```bash
# inside the dev shell
setup-lazyvim
```

this will clone the lazyvim starter configuration to `~/.config/nvim`. then run `nvim` to complete the initial setup. the lazyvim configuration includes:

- lsp support for python, c/c++, and more
- treesitter for syntax highlighting
- telescope for fuzzy finding
- git integration
- terminal support
- markdown preview

## adding packages

the environment uses robostack to provide ros2 humble packages. to add a package:

```bash
pixi add <PACKAGE_NAME>
```

find available ros2-humble packages in the [robostack channel](https://robostack.github.io/humble.html).

## using a different shell

nix shells default to bash, but you can use your preferred shell. if you want to use a different shell (like zsh, fish, or nushell), you have a few options:

### manual approach

```bash
nix develop -c env 'SHELL=<your-shell-path-here>' <your-shell-path-here>
```

for example, with nushell:

```bash
nix develop -c env 'SHELL=/bin/nu' /bin/nu
```

### create an alias

add this alias to your shell configuration for easier access:

```bash
alias devshell="nix develop -c env 'SHELL=/bin/bash' /bin/bash"
```

### nushell function

if you use nushell, create this function in your `env.nu`:

```nu
def devshell [] {
  let shell_path = "/bin/nu"
  nix develop -c env $'SHELL=($shell_path)' $shell_path
}
```

then simply run `devshell` to enter the environment with nushell.

## bash function

you can also create a bash function for easier access. add this to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
devshell() {
  local shell_path="/bin/bash"  # change this to your preferred shell path
  nix develop -c env "SHELL=$shell_path" "$shell_path"
}
```

this should do the same as the nushell function defined above but for bash users.

### with nom

if you use nom for better nix output, replace `nix` with `nom`:

```bash
nom develop -c env 'SHELL=/bin/nu' /bin/nu
```

## environment details

the workspace includes:

- **ros**: ros-humble-desktop with all core ros packages
- **build tools**: cmake, ninja, make, compilers, pkg-config
- **ros tools**: colcon, rosdep, catkin_tools
- **python**: 3.11.x with development headers
- **platforms**: supports linux-64, linux-aarch64, osx-64, osx-arm64

## workspace structure

```
ros2-humble-env/
├── flake.nix          # nix flake configuration
├── pixi.toml          # pixi workspace definition
├── pixi.lock          # locked dependency versions
└── README.md          # this file
```

## useful commands

once in the development environment, sourcing ros is not needed as that is all handled by pixi automatically.

```bash
# build ros packages with colcon
colcon build

# list all available ros humble robostack packages
pixi search ros-humble-*

# search for a specific ros2 package, like all packages containing "rosidl" in the name
pixi search *rosidl*

# add a new package
pixi add ros-humble-<package-name>
```

it's worth noting that it's also recommended to add python packages to pixi's env as well. let's say you need `pygame`, for example, then you'd add it by doing `pixi add pygame` (which would alter the `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock` files).
