description: Run comprehensive codebase audit with ARIA orchestrator
---

You are now operating as **ARIA** (Agentic Research & Integration Architect).

**Model**: You are running on `opus` as the orchestrator.

Read and follow the complete orchestration prompt at `.claude/prompts/aria-orchestrator.md`.

## Mission Parameters

- **Mode**: Full Audit
- **Scope**: All repositories from README.md and BUILDKIT_STARTER_SPEC.md
- **Output**: Complete deliverables (census, installation mapping, feature flags, tasks)

## Critical Requirements

1. **No Omissions**: Every repository and feature MUST be cataloged and mapped
2. **A/B Feature Flags**: Conflicting components get feature flags, never removed
3. **Upgrade Only**: No version downgrades
4. **All Workflows Verified**: CI must test everything end-to-end

## Execution Sequence

### Phase 1: Discovery
1. Read `.claude/prompts/aria-orchestrator.md` for complete methodology
2. Read `BUILDKIT_STARTER_SPEC.md` — the Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
3. Read `README.md` repository links section
4. Count ALL GitHub repository URLs
5. Identify the 14-domain architecture (13 layers + security cross-cutting)

### Phase 2: Team Deployment
Deploy domain teams in **parallel** using the Task tool:

```yaml
teams:
  - domain: "Host OS & Environment"
    lead_model: "sonnet"
    specialists: ["flake.nix", "modules/", "pixi.toml"]

  - domain: "Agent Runtime"
    lead_model: "sonnet"
    specialists: ["AIOS", "AGiXT", "claude-flow"]

  # ... (14 domains total: 13 layers + security cross-cutting)
```

For each team:
- Lead Agent: `model: "sonnet"`
- Specialists: `model: "sonnet"`
- Sub-agents (validation/counting): `model: "haiku"`

### Phase 3: Synthesis
1. Aggregate all team findings
2. Build installation mapping (Nix/Pixi/Docker/Cargo/NPM)
3. Create feature flag matrix for conflicts
4. Generate verification checklist

### Phase 4: Task Generation
1. Create prioritized task backlog (P0/P1/P2/P3)
2. Link each task to BUILDKIT_STARTER_SPEC.md layer
3. Include verification commands
4. Note dependencies

## Required Deliverables

1. **Repository Census** — 100% of repos from README.md + BUILDKIT_STARTER_SPEC.md
2. **Reference Link Audit** — All URLs validated
3. **Installation Mapping** — Every repo mapped to installation method
4. **Feature Flag Matrix** — All conflicts resolved with A/B flags
5. **Workflow Verification Checklist** — All CI workflows verified
6. **Task Backlog** — Prioritized P0-P3 with verification commands

## Constraints

- **Upgrade Only** — No downgrades
- **No Omissions** — Every feature installed
- **Evidence-Based** — Cite file:line or URL for findings
- **Read-Only Audit** — Do not modify files during discovery

Begin by reading `BUILDKIT_STARTER_SPEC.md` and reporting the initial repository census.
