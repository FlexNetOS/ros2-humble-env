# mTLS Implementation Checklist for ARIA Platform

This checklist guides you through enabling mutual TLS (mTLS) on all ARIA services as part of task P2-005.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Step-CA initialized (`./scripts/init-step-ca.sh`)
- [ ] Docker and docker-compose installed
- [ ] Step-CLI available in nix development environment
- [ ] All services defined in docker-compose files

## Phase 1: Certificate Authority Setup

### 1.1 Initialize Step-CA

```bash
# Initialize the CA (one-time setup)
./scripts/init-step-ca.sh

# Expected output:
# - Root CA certificate created
# - Intermediate CA certificate created
# - JWK provisioner configured
# - Password file generated
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] File exists: `/home/user/ros2-humble-env/config/step-ca/pki/root_ca.crt`
- [ ] File exists: `/home/user/ros2-humble-env/config/step-ca/pki/intermediate_ca.crt`
- [ ] File exists: `/home/user/ros2-humble-env/config/step-ca/secrets/password.txt`

### 1.2 Start Step-CA

```bash
# Start the certificate authority
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.identity.yml up -d step-ca

# Wait for healthy status
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.identity.yml ps step-ca

# Test CA health
step ca health \
  --ca-url https://localhost:9000 \
  --root config/step-ca/pki/root_ca.crt
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Step-CA container is running
- [ ] Health check returns: "step-ca is running"
- [ ] Port 9000 is accessible

## Phase 2: Service Certificate Generation

### 2.1 Generate Certificates

```bash

./scripts/generate-service-certs.sh

# Expected: Certificates for 8 services
# - keycloak
# - vaultwarden
# - vault
# - temporal
# - postgres
# - grafana
# - prometheus
# - nats
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Certificates created in `/home/user/ros2-humble-env/data/certs/<service>/`
- [ ] Each service has `.crt` and `.key` files
- [ ] Root CA copied to `/home/user/ros2-humble-env/data/certs/aria-root-ca.crt`
- [ ] Key files have 600 permissions
- [ ] Certificate files have 644 permissions

### 2.2 Verify Certificates

```bash
# Inspect a certificate
step certificate inspect data/certs/keycloak/keycloak.crt

# Verify certificate chain
step certificate verify \
  data/certs/keycloak/keycloak.crt \
  --roots config/step-ca/pki/root_ca.crt

# Check all certificates
for service in keycloak vault vaultwarden temporal postgres grafana prometheus nats; do
  echo "Checking $service..."
  step certificate verify \
    "data/certs/$service/$service.crt" \
    --roots config/step-ca/pki/root_ca.crt
done
```

**Verification:**

- [ ] Check for weak keys
- [ ] Validate certificate chains
- [ ] Review access logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Certificate verification failed | Check root CA trust, verify SANs match hostname |
| Service won't start with mTLS | Check certificate/key permissions, verify paths |
| Certificate expired | Run `./scripts/rotate-certs.sh` to renew |
| CA health check fails | Ensure step-ca container is running, check port 9000 |
| Permission denied on key file | `chmod 600 *.key` and check file ownership |

### Getting Help

1. Review logs: `docker-compose logs <service>`
2. Check mTLS setup guide: `docs/MTLS_SETUP.md`
3. Verify step-ca status: `step ca health`
4. Review certificate details: `step certificate inspect <file>`

## Success Criteria
