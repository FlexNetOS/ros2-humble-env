# Holochain packages from overlay (P0 - MANDATORY per BUILDKIT_STARTER_SPEC.md)
# P3-006: Holochain reference tools (Phase 3 - Development tooling)
#
# The 'hc' CLI provides comprehensive development commands:
#   - hc sandbox    : Generate and run test networks for development
#   - hc scaffold   : Generate DNA, zome, and entry type templates
#   - hc dna        : DNA operations (init, pack, unpack)
#   - hc app        : hApp bundle operations (pack, unpack)
#   - hc web-app    : Web hApp operations
#
# For additional launch capabilities:
#   - Use 'hc sandbox' for local development environments
#   - For production: holochain conductor with conductor.yaml config
#   - Alternative: Install @holochain/hc-spin via npm for enhanced DX
